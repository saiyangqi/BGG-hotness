# BGG Hotness Android App

An Android App that displays the newest Hotness rank from BGG ([BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/)).

## Background

### About BGG
[BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) is a website for board gaming enthusiasts around the world.</br></br>
The site hosts a board game database that contains detailed information for over 80,000 board games.</br></br>
It has a ranking system called "The Hotness", which lists the Top 50 board games that are being discussed by the members currently.

### About Me
My name is Saiyang Qi and I'm a pretty inexperienced programmer who graduated from Stony Brook University with a CS Master's Degree last year.</br></br>
Through my academic years, I never got a chance to learn Android. At some point after I graduated, I grew some interests in Android Programming, and since I knew Core Java well, I decided to give it a shot as a side hobby.</br></br>
I have been taking Android Basic classes from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) on and off, and I have really enjoyed the content so far.</br></br>
My goal is to become a real Android Programmer one day.  

### About this App
In addtion to being a programmer, I'm also a huge board game fan.</br></br>
I discoverd the modern board gaming some time during my last year at school. Ever since, I have built a not so small game collection and I enjoy playing all of them.</br></br>
Just like many other board gamers around the globe, I visit [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) regularly, and I often use their "The Hotness" rank to discover new/popular games.</br></br>
Though, to be honest, their web design is abysmal in my opinion, and absolutely not mobile friendly.</br></br>
So ultimately, I decided to apply what I have learnt so far from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) courses and build a simple app for both practicing and personal usage.</br></br>
